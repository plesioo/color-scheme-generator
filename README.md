# color-scheme-generator
This is a **Scrimba project** from the Frontend Developer Career Path, to practice **Working with APIs**. It consists of a colors-scheme-generator that uses The Color API to get color schemes.

In addition to the project requirements I added:
- support for black and white mode
- the ability to copy hex values when a color is clicked
- local storage and a random generated color scheme on the first visit

The number of colors can be adjusted by changing the 'colorAmount' variable in [script.js](./script.js)
